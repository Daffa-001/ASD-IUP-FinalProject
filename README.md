# Backround
In the chaotic environment of modern home cooking, food waste and decision fatigue are constant battles. "Mom's Kitchen Helper" addresses the age-old question: "What should I cook today?"

Often, refrigerators are filled with ingredients nearing their expiration dates, while users struggle to find recipes that match their available stock. This application transforms the kitchen into an efficient, algorithm-driven environment. By managing inventory life-cycles and mapping relationships between ingredients and recipes, the application minimizes waste and maximizes culinary creativity.

# Application Overview
# Core Features
- Smart Pantry Management: Tracks ingredient quantity and freshness.
- Recipe Database: A curated collection of recipes tagged by difficulty, cuisine, and dietary restrictions.
- "What's in My Fridge?" Search: Instantly filters recipes based on currently available ingredients.
- Expiration Alerts: Prioritizes ingredients that need to be used immediately.
- Automated Shopping List: Generates missing items based on selected meal plans.
# The "Freshness" System
- Green Status: Ingredient is fresh (> 5 days to expiry).
- Yellow Status: Use soon (2–5 days to expiry).
- Red Status: Critical (Expires in < 48 hours). Priority algorithm bumps these to the top of search results.

# Modes
1. Inventory First Mode
Finds recipes that utilize the maximum number of "Red Status" ingredients to prevent food waste.
2. Quick Cook Mode
Sorts and filters recipes strictly by preparation time (Shortest First) for busy users.
